        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All teams have 3 minutes to come up with the numbers on the right, using the sets of numbers on the
                left.</li>
            <li>Only one set of numbers can be used for each goal.</li>
            <li>Each number from each set may only be used once.</li>
            <li>Not every number in each set needs to be used, i.e. you can use only 5 out of 6 numbers or less.
            </li>
            <li>Sets can be re-used between different goals, or not used at all.</li>
            <li>You may use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and raising to a power, but your final
                answer must be an integer. No factorials or square roots.</li>
            <li>Your team's score is the sum of the difference between the numbers you form and the numbers on the
                screen.</li>
            <li>If you fail to form a number, that counts as 10 score.</li>
            <li>The team with the lowest score at the end of the round is the winner!</li>
        </ul>
